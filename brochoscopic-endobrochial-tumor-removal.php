                              <p>Tumours located in the central airway can cause central airway obstruction leading to morbidity and mortality. Tumours which are located purely within the airway lumen can be removed in-toto via bronchoscopy. This procedure called as bronchoscopic surgery is a scar less procedure. Procedure is performed via rigid bronchoscopy. Several tools such as cryoprobe, electrocautery accessories, rigid bronchoscopic forceps are used to remove the tumor depending on the type and the site of the tumor.</p>

                      <h3>Case Vignette</h3>
                      <p><b>Case 1:</b> A 60 year man presented with a non-resolving left lower lobe pneumonia. CT and bronchoscopy showed a lesion in the lumen of the left main bronchus. Endobronchial removal of the lesion performed which confirmed it to be a endobronchial chondrohamartoma.</p>

                      <p><b>Case 2:</b> A 30-year male, on anti-tubercular therapy, presented with worsening breathlessness. Bronchoscopy showed tumors causing near complete occlusion of the opening of both main bronchi. The tumors were removed using a combination of electrocautery snare, forceps and a cryoprobe. Histopathology confirmed granulomas and exuberant granulation tissue (Tumorous endo-bronchial tuberculosis). ATT was continued and the index case gradually recovered.</p>
