                              <p>Whole lung lavage (WLL) is a unique procedure performed for patients with symptomatic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). In PAP, the alveoli get filled with proteinaceous surfactant and this leads to respiratory failure. In this procedure, under general anaesthesia, after isolating both the lungs with a double lumen endo-tracheal tube, the lungs are lavaged with serial aliquots of normal saline (700-1200 ml per cycle). 20 to 30 such cycles are performed for each lung, and the cycles are continued till the effluent clears up.</p>

                         <ul>
                             <li>1. Performed the first successful WLL procedure in the state of Telangana.</li>
                            <li> 2. Performed the highest number of WLL procedures in South India.</li>

                      <h3>Case Vignette</h3>
                      <p>A 45 year lady was referred to us with progressive respiratory failure. HRCT showed crazy paving appearance. A cryo lung biopsy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Sequential whole lung lavage was performed for both the lungs using a total of 60L normal saline. Her respiratory failure recovered, and she remains asymptomatic one year after procedure, and is under follow up.</p>
