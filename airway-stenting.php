                              <p>An airway stent is an endobronchial/endotracheal prosthesis that supports and maintains patency of the airways. The main classes of stents that are currently being used are silicone stents (benign diseases) and covered metallic stents (malignant stenoses). Procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia and rigid bronchoscopy. Covered metallic stents can be placed under conscious sedation using flexible bronchoscope. After sufficient tracheal diameter is achieved using various modalities, the size and type of stent is decided and placed. A hitch stitch maybe placed to prevent stent migration.</p>

                      <h3>Indications</h3>
                      <ul>
                         <li>1. Malignant airway obstruction (intrinsic, extrinsic or mixed lesions)</li>
                         <li>2. alignant tracheobronchial fistula</li>
                         <li>3. Benign airway stenosis (when surgery is not feasible)</li>
                         <li>4. Post-transplant airway stenosis</li>
                         <li>5. Tracheobronchomalacia (uncommon indication)</li>
                       </ul>

                      <h3>Case Vignette</h3>
                      <p><b>Case 1:</b> 55-year lady, with rapidly worsening stridor for 1 month, was referred to us for management. She had stridor at rest. Bronchoscopy showed growth in lower trachea and proximal parts of both main bronchi, with near complete occlusion of right main bronchus. Rigid bronchoscopic removal of tumor was performed using the coring technique and cryodebulking. This was followed by placement of a metallic 'Y' shaped self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) of 16 x 12 x 12mm size. There was immediate relief in stridor. Biopsy confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma.</p>

                      <p><b>Case 2:</b> 25-year-old male with recurrent suicidal tendencies, was intubated and ventilated due to intentional overdose of antidepressants given for treatment of an earlier suicidal attempt. Two months following recovery, he presented with worsening dyspnoea and stridor. Bronchoscopy showed a Grade 3 upper tracheal stenosis with a lumen of only 2 mm in diameter. Under general anaesthesia, rigid bronchoscopic intubation was done. Electrocautery cuts were given followed by CRE Balloon and rigid bronchoscopic dilation. A silicone stent (14x50mm) was then deployed, and a hitch stitch placed to prevent stent displacement.</p>
